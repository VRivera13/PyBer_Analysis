# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Based on the ride share data collected for city types, urban, suburban, and rural, it has been requested that a summary DataFrame be created that will summarize the ride-sharing data by each city type.   This information will be used to outline the differences between the city types and be used as a tool to help make any necessary decisions at PyBer.

## Results
The collected data shows that the Urban city type tends to have more rides that the other city types.    The 2nd city type, Suburban, has 1000 less rides than the Urban city type.    The total number of drivers in the Urban city type topple the Suburban and Rural city types, with a large total of 2405 drivers, to the 490 drivers in Suburban city type and 78 drivers in the Rural city type.  That is a significant difference.    The population tends to be larger in Urban city types which would be the reason the differnces in rides and drivers is so much larger that the other city types.   Also noticed that even though the Urban city types have more rides and drivers, the average fare per driver dropps significantly compare to Rural city types.

## Summary
Based on the data the Rural city types tend to have the least amount of rides and drivers, but ther average fare per ride is higher.   The cost of using PyBer may not be beneficial for the rider being the cost is more and the availability of drivers is less than the other locations.   1) Suggestion would be to provide a promotional low cost time frame where riders get a discount for using the service within a certain time frame or earn point after so many rides towards a free ride.   2) Possibly even a promo for drivers to visit the rural areas for promotional purposes where they will earn more fare (at PyBer cost not the rider) during certain times to promote driver availability to the Rural areas.   3) To reduce the congestion of drivers in the Urban area, provide a driver promotion where if they pick up more in the Suburban area, they will receive some type of incentive.    These options can possibll lead to a leveling out of the differences between the city types.
